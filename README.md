#Simple Instagram Photostream with jQuery

To simply show your last photos from instagram. Nothing more, nothing less ;)

First you need a Access Token. Just register an app at http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/ and fill in the Access Token in the js-file.

You also need to replace {user-id} with your user-id. 
You can get your user-id here: http://yvesvanbroekhoven.github.com/get-your-instagram-user-id/
